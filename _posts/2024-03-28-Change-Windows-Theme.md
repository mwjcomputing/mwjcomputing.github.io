title: PowerShell Function to Change Windows Theme
published: true
---

I am a heavy Mac user these days, but still use Windows on a frequent basis for support of my clients and some light gaming. I love that my Mac sets the theme between light and dark mode automatically. So I set out to find a way to do this.

Sadly, there I could not find a way to do this on sunrise and sunset, however I was able to find a way to do this at a PowerShell prompt. So introducing Set-WindowsTheme. You can add this function to your PowerShell profile, and then set the theme between light and dark mode at will.
